What I learned
We can use background-color with background-image.

The color will appear if the image is not loaded.
Add icon from Font Awesome using unicode.

         li::before {
            font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';
            content: '\f108';
            font-weight: 900;
         }
Some icons won't appear if we don't use font-wight .

We can change the quotation marks of <q> with another from font awesome using ::after & ::before.

We can use ::placeholder pseudo element to style the placeholder of input.
